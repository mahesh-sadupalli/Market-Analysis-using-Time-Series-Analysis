# S&P 500 Market Prediction Model

This project includes the development of a market prediction model for the S&P 500 index, combining the strengths of machine learning and time series analysis to forecast market trends and closing prices.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately predict the future movements of the S&P 500 stock index. By integrating ARIMA models for time series forecasting with Random Forest for trend classification, we aim to provide a comprehensive approach to understanding market dynamics.

## Technologies & Algorithms

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **yfinance**: Fetching historical market data.
- **statsmodels**: Implementation of the ARIMA model for time series analysis.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Trend prediction based on historical data.

## Achievements

- Achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 326.585, demonstrating the model's accuracy.
- Attained high precision in predicting the market trend direction, which could significantly aid in decision-making processes for investors.

## Future Work

The next phase of the project will explore the integration of sentiment analysis to include market sentiment data. Additionally, the application of LSTM networks is planned to refine the predictions further and capture long-term dependencies in market movements.

## How to Use
